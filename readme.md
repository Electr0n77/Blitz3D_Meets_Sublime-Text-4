# What the Hell Does This do?

Fully integrates Blitz3D into Sublime Text 4!

## Why Would You Take the Time to Painstakingly Integrate a Modern, Open-Source Text Editor With a Programming Language Created in the 90s?

Why don't you take the time to shut the hell up?

## Point Taken, but Still... What Does "Fully Integrates" Mean?

Oh, you are in for a treat!

# Okay but Seriously, What is This and Why do I Need it?

This package is the result of two unhealthy love interests of mine that were destined to be together, but the cruel triflings of fate kept them separated for decades simply because, "Nobody uses BlitzBasic anymore" and... well... yeah that's all I got.

Jokes aside I really do love Blitz3D; I think it's a very capable programming language that's literally so easy to learn that I ended up getting better at problem-solving and understanding program logic because the syntax took an hour to seep into my porous brain at *most*. Naturally, my unhealthy obsession with ***SUBLIME TEXT*** would inevitably kick in and that brings us to this little package I found on Github.

The only issue is that this thing was made, like, eight years ago so needless to say... an update is long overdue.
